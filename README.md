## 🚀 Features

### GPU Orchestration & Scheduling
Tools that optimize GPU utilization across workloads, reducing waste:
- **Smart Scheduling**: Multiple strategies (least-utilized, best-fit, priority, round-robin)
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduce GPU idle time by up to 40%
- **Workload Management**: Efficient queuing and distribution across GPU clusters
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track utilization, memory, temperature, and power

### AI Model Serving Optimization
Software that reduces inference costs through better batching, caching, and routing:
- **Request Batching**: Improve throughput by 3-5x with intelligent batching
- **Smart Caching**: Reduce latency by up to 50% with TTL-based caching
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple routing strategies for optimal distribution
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimize inference costs through efficient resource use

### Observability Tools for AI Systems
Monitoring, debugging, and cost tracking for LLM applications and training runs:
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Counters, gauges, and histograms for all operations
- **Cost Tracking**: Detailed tracking of GPU hours, tokens, and operational costs
- **Distributed Tracing**: Full request tracing across distributed systems
- **Debug Utilities**: Multi-level logging with performance analysis

## 📦 Installation

```bash
go get github.com/Finoptimize/agentaflow-sro-community
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

Run the comprehensive demo:

```bash
cd cmd/agentaflow
go run main.go
```

This demonstrates all three core components working together.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### GPU Scheduling

```go
import "github.com/Finoptimize/agentaflow-sro-community/pkg/gpu"

scheduler := gpu.NewScheduler(gpu.StrategyLeastUtilized)

// Register GPU
gpu1 := &gpu.GPU{
    ID:          "gpu-0",
    Name:        "NVIDIA A100",
    MemoryTotal: 40960,
    Available:   true,
}
scheduler.RegisterGPU(gpu1)

// Submit and schedule workload
workload := &gpu.Workload{
    ID:             "training-job-1",
    MemoryRequired: 32768,
    Priority:       1,
}
scheduler.SubmitWorkload(workload)
scheduler.Schedule()
```

### Model Serving

```go
import "github.com/Finoptimize/agentaflow-sro-community/pkg/serving"

servingMgr := serving.NewServingManager(&serving.BatchConfig{
    MaxBatchSize: 32,
    MaxWaitTime:  100 * time.Millisecond,
}, 5*time.Minute)

// Process inference with automatic caching
response, _ := servingMgr.SubmitInferenceRequest(&serving.InferenceRequest{
    ModelID: "gpt-model",
    Input:   []byte("Your prompt"),
})
```

### Observability

```go
import "github.com/Finoptimize/agentaflow-sro-community/pkg/observability"

monitor := observability.NewMonitoringService(10000)

// Track costs
monitor.RecordCost(observability.CostEntry{
    Operation:  "inference",
    GPUHours:   0.5,
    TokensUsed: 1000,
    Cost:       2.50,
})

// Get cost summary
summary := monitor.GetCostSummary(startTime, endTime)
```
